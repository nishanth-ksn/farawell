                <p>Have each team select a Team Captain. Then ask each Team Captain to come to the front of the room, each bringing a buzzer with them. After that, the host reads the first question.</p>

                <p>Next, the Team Captains face-off by trying to beat each other to hitting their buzzer and answering the question first. The Team Captain who hits the buzzer first has five seconds to give an answer that is listed on the Family Feud questions and answers sheet. If the first Team Captain fails to give a correct answer, the other Team Captain gets a chance to guess.
                </p>
                <p>The team whose Captain gives a correct answer first gets the chance to play this round of the game. If their team doesn't want to play, they can pass the chance to play the round to the opposing team. The team who chooses to play this round gets to guess the remaining top answers to the question.</p>
                <p>Each team member gets a chance to give an answer, one by one, until they’ve found all the answers or gotten three wrong answers (or strikes). If they clear the board and get all the top answers, they get the total number of points for their answers. If they get three strikes during the round, the second team gets one chance to steal the points. If the second team gives a correct answer, the host adds the number of points (Important note: the correct points for each answer are listed in parentheses next to the answer).</p>
                <p>If the opposing team fails, the first team keeps their points for that round. At the end of the round, the host should add up each team’s points and write them on the scorecard.</p>
                <p class="last">To begin the second round, a new member from each team must come up to the front of the room and prepare to answer the next question.</p>
